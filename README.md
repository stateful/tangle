# vscoderx README

VS Code RX state synchronization across multiple webviews

## Development

Ideally load this repo inside of VS Code.

```bash
$ cd ./vscoderx
$ code .
$ yarn install
```

Use `CMD+SHIFT+B` keyboard shortcut to run default build task or run `$ yarn run watch` from the commandline. You should be ready after both extension & webview js-bundles were generated by webpack.

## Roadmap

- [x] Extension-side VRX API draft implementation
- [x] Support transient state
- [x] Support events
- [ ] Support persistent state
- [ ] Webview-side VRX API
- [ ] Share classes (library) between extension & webview bundles

## Launch extension

Once the bundles are ready hit `F5` to launch the extension in a Development Extension host (VS Code window) or click `Run Extension (vscoderx)` from the status bar.
